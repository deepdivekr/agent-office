# Phase 111 — Work delivery verification

Candidate v0.4.0, Ubuntu 24.04 / Node 22.22.0 / npm 11.11.0. Local release gates passed; protected CI and published installation checks remain separate publication gates.

## Implemented scope

- Private named Telegram, Slack and Discord settings, with stored/unverified status rather than an invented successful connection.
- Explicit intake completion requirements and destination choices saved separately from the model plan, including replay-conflict checks and backward-compatible one-line requests.
- Automatic delivery of independently verified new Work output, durable per-target receipts and recipient/configuration bindings.
- Multi-selection in onboarding/settings, new Work and the final delivery-stage modal, with readable per-channel errors.
- Original-runtime sender ownership retained. No imported bot is duplicated or silently redirected.

Local contract tests use provider response substitutes. Actual loopback HTTP tests exercise the production routes, SQLite, Work supervision and delivery pump while intercepting all external messenger requests. These are not proof of a live account receiving a message.

The final affected reporter passed 166/166 (57 unit, 50 contract-fake, 46 fixture integration and 13 native integration). Evidence: `runtime-tests-2026-09-30T03-29-02-204Z.json`.

Retained preceding runs:

- `runtime-tests-2026-09-30T03-30-35-283Z.json`: 1,658/1,659; the older setup test expected four steps rather than five. Its corrected desktop/mobile flow passed 2/2 in `runtime-tests-2026-09-30T03-53-48-497Z.json`.
- The next run at `48bc430` was intentionally stopped without a final reporter artifact to fix undated historical pending/running activity beneath verified stages. `phase111-interrupted-48bc430.json` is not a pass. The dated history fix passed focused UI 12/12 and actual completed-stage review.
- `runtime-tests-2026-09-30T04-11-05-243Z.json`: 1,659/1,660; the native settings test read an earlier status before asynchronous API-consent validation settled. The test now waits for the exact warning and also proves zero provider calls and no saved setting without consent. Production behavior was unchanged. Desktop/mobile repetition passed 5/5 and focused reporter 2/2 (`runtime-tests-2026-09-30T04-27-49-612Z.json`).

Final frozen quick at `e26a50c`: **1,660/1,660 PASS**, 0 blocked, 0 not-run. Evidence: `runtime-tests-2026-09-30T04-29-07-518Z.json`; 652 contract-fake, 324 fixture-integration, 490 unit and 194 native-integration checks. Input-integrity and independent post-run input comparison passed; source/tests/dist remained unchanged. Long soak is excluded. Earlier failures and interrupted runs remain preserved, not relabeled.

The candidate `a37f84f931f8d8094c015e53e9ea2742dedda632` disposable installer passed fresh installation and upgrades from v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.2.0, v0.3.0 and v0.3.1: **6/6** (`release-install/2026-09-30T04-11-16.535Z.json`), with real dependencies, Chromium, wrapper and MCP checks but fixture models and zero external model calls. The later `e26a50c` correction changes only the test; production source, packaging and installer are identical. The previous `588fced` 6/6 result remains retained. Neither run touched the personal installation.

Actual Neo checks cover KO/EN setup at 390px and 1440px, closed help, no horizontal overflow and the final-stage modal. Saving the already-selected app-only destination on a verified Node Work changed its selection revision and retained `available`; no external message was sent. Neo click interference under mobile emulation was diagnosed separately from application behavior.

The isolated Node Work completed after one UI Start action: official page read, local TXT save/readback, independent completion and persisted app result. The separate ACME Work remains awaiting review for unresolved material evidence. Its preserved intervention and result are not presented as successful independent completion. See [Phase110 evidence](phase-110-work-stages.md).

The isolated actual-use server was safely stopped after confirming zero active Work and zero pending/sending deliveries; result hashes stayed unchanged. Evidence: `phase110-live-server-restart-20260930.json`.

## Remaining publication gates

- Initial remote push/PR checks at `4a22633` failed before runtime tests: older status entries RQ-863/873/877 referenced ignored local evidence as required public files. Those references are retained under `private_evidence`, with tracked verification/handoff records as public evidence. This is a publication-record fix; no tests or product behavior are removed. Retain failed runs `36671331153` and `36671386143`.
- Publish through protected PR/CI and inspect the release assets plus published installer.

No real messenger send is authorized for this validation. Generated original files remain app downloads; messenger delivery sends result text. Uncertain delivery requires reconciliation rather than automated retry.

## Final publication

PR34 merged as `7efc86253b2476672b38f91cc519b5a94b424cce`; main CI36672600844 runtime/release passed and published immutable v0.4.0. PR/main artifacts contain1659PASS/1NOT_RUN for unavailable headed display, not1660 remote passes; the omitted fixture passed locally. Exact-main CI installer6/6, published-tag installer6/6 and downloaded Release installer asset fresh1/1 passed. All installed commits match the published tag, with fixture models and zero external model calls. Source archive and installer bytes/checksums independently matched. [Post-publication receipt](../validation/v0.4.0-publication.json) records scope and retained limits; the tag's preceding gate snapshot remains immutable.
