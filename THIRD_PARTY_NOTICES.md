# Third-party notices

Agent Driver's original code is licensed under Apache-2.0. Dependencies keep their own licenses; this repository's license does not replace them.

The public source export does not vendor `node_modules`, browser binaries, VM images, or model weights. `npm ci` installs the exact dependency versions recorded in `package-lock.json`, including their upstream license files. Preserve those notices when redistributing an installation or a bundled build.

## Direct public-package dependencies

### Bundled typeface

The Control Center includes the unmodified Pretendard Variable v1.3.9 WOFF2
by Kil Hyung-jin, under SIL Open Font License 1.1 (not Apache-2.0).
See [the font license](assets/fonts/OFL.txt) and [source provenance](assets/fonts/README.md).
It is served locally; opening the Control Center does not contact a font CDN.

This inventory was checked against the installed package metadata and lockfile on 2026-09-23. It is not a replacement for the license text shipped by each package.

## Separately installed software and services

- Node.js, Chromium and its components, QEMU/KVM, Linux distributions, VNC tools, and external agent clients retain their own licenses. They are not relicensed by Agent Driver.
- Browser installations can contain additional notices. Redistribution of a browser, VM image, container, or appliance needs its own complete dependency inventory.
- Jev and LLM APIs are connected services, not model code or model weights included in this repository. API credentials and provider subscriptions are not included.
- Documentation may link to third-party research and services. Such links do not transfer ownership of their content or imply endorsement.
- `docs/assets/validation/contact-draft.png` depicts the Browserbase public contact page as an execution record. Website content, logos, and trademarks remain their respective owners' property; the screenshot does not imply endorsement or relicense those elements.

For the public source package, the lockfile is the exact version inventory. Before redistributing a bundled binary or hosted appliance, inspect the installed transitive dependencies and preserve the applicable notices as well.
